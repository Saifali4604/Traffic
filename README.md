# Adaptive and Sustainable Traffic Management System
A project for BIT hackathon 

#Abstract:
In urban environments, efficient traffic management is crucial for safety, convenience, and environmental sustainability. Our project aims to develop a smart traffic system that adapts to real-time conditions and enhances road safety through several innovative features:

##Adaptive Traffic Light Timing: By monitoring the density of vehicles and detecting the presence of pedestrians, including elderly and visually impaired individuals, our system adjusts traffic light timings dynamically. This ensures smoother traffic flow and safer pedestrian crossings.

##Ambulance Priority System: Utilizing ESP-NOW technology, ambulances send pre-emptive signals to our traffic system. Upon receiving this signal, the system adjusts traffic lights to create a clear path for the ambulance and activates blue LEDs on traffic lights, alerting other drivers to yield.

##Energy Harvesting and Vehicle Weight Monitoring: Our system incorporates strain gauges and piezoelectric sensors to harness energy from vehicular movement. This harvested energy powers the traffic system and provides real-time weight measurements of vehicles. By identifying overloaded vehicles, we can prevent potential traffic jams and road damage.

##Environmental Monitoring: Integrated air quality and noise sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions. This data is displayed on traffic lights with animations, raising public awareness about pollution levels and encouraging eco-friendly behavior.

Our adaptive and sustainable traffic management system not only improves traffic efficiency but also enhances safety and environmental consciousness. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and real-time data, we aim to create a smarter, safer, and greener urban transportation network.
